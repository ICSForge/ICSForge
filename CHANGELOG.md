# ICSForge Changelog

## v0.45.2 (2026-03 — MQTT Release)

### New Protocol: MQTT 3.1.1
- Full MQTT packet framing per OASIS MQTT v3.1.1 standard (TCP port 1883)
- 13 payload styles: connect, connect_anon, connect_creds, publish_command, publish_setpoint, publish_firmware, publish_config, publish_c2, subscribe_all, subscribe_scada, unsubscribe, pingreq, disconnect
- 20 new scenarios covering T0801, T0802, T0812, T0815, T0822, T0826, T0831, T0836, T0841, T0843, T0855, T0859, T0869, T0882
- Registered in scenario engine, live sender (TCP_PROTOS), and receiver config
- IIoT/Sparkplug B topic naming conventions

### Receiver Default Port → 9090
- Receiver web UI now defaults to port 9090 (was 8080) to avoid conflicts on single-host setups
- Updated: receiver CLI default, Dockerfile.receiver EXPOSE+CMD, docker-compose.yml mapping, README
- Sender callback push defaults to receiver_port=9090
- Sender stays on :8080, receiver on :9090

### Receiver → Sender HTTP Callback
- Receiver HTTP POSTs each receipt to sender for live UI updates
- New receiver config: `callback.url` in config.yml + `--callback-url` CLI argument
- Fire-and-forget async callback via daemon thread (non-blocking receipt pipeline)
- Sender endpoints: `POST /api/receiver/callback`, `GET /api/receiver/live`
- Receiver endpoint: `POST /api/config/set_callback` (accepts callback URL push from sender)
- Callback URL auto-derived from sender host:port when receiver IP is configured

### Network Settings UI (IP Configuration)
- New "Network Settings" bar at top of sender dashboard: sender IP, receiver IP, receiver port
- `GET/POST /api/config/network` — combined config endpoint for both IPs
- On page load, saved IPs are fetched and prefilled into all scenario fields
- "Save & Connect" pushes callback URL to receiver and confirms link status
- Destination IP field no longer hardcoded to 198.51.100.42 — filled from saved config
- Offline PCAP mode also uses configured receiver IP as fallback
- BACnet and MQTT added to protocol color map in UI

### Authentication
- First-run setup flow: no credentials → redirect to `/setup` → create admin account
- Session-based auth with Flask secure cookies
- SHA-256 + per-user salt password hashing (no external dependencies)
- Public paths exempt: `/health`, `/api/health`, `/api/receiver/callback`, `/api/config/set_callback`, `/static/`
- `--no-auth` CLI flag and `ICSFORGE_NO_AUTH=1` env var for development
- Credentials stored in `~/.icsforge/credentials.json` (0600 permissions)

### PCAP Validation Script
- `scripts/validate_pcaps.py` — validates every scenario's PCAP output
- Struct-only mode (no external deps): checks magic, version, linktype, packet counts, ports, IP proto
- Optional `--tshark` mode: full Wireshark dissection, detects malformed frames
- `--quick` mode: one scenario per protocol + all CHAINs (19 tests in ~2 minutes)
- `--scenario NAME` mode: test a single specific scenario
- Multi-protocol CHAIN scenarios correctly validated (first packet matches any step's protocol)
- Handles L2 PROFINET frames gracefully (skips IP-layer port checks)

### UI Redesign — Industrial Control Room Terminal
- Complete CSS overhaul: "SCADA operator workstation" aesthetic
- Fonts: Oxanium (display/headings), Chakra Petch (body), JetBrains Mono (code)
- Glowing amber indicators with text-shadow and box-shadow glow effects
- Beveled glass instrument panels with inset shadows and subtle top highlights
- Scanline background texture for authentic control room feel
- Staggered fade-in animations on card load
- Custom scrollbar styling matching industrial theme
- Full dark/light mode with distinct palettes (both industrial, not generic)
- All existing class names preserved — zero template breakage

### Updated Numbers
- 175 runnable scenarios (was 155)
- 72 ATT&CK for ICS technique IDs
- 9 industrial protocols (added MQTT)

## v0.43.0 (2026-03 — Lean Cleanup Release)

### Dead Weight Removed
- **`icsforge/scenarios/matrix.yml`** (2,457 lines) — auto-generated file with zero Python references. The tool uses `scenarios.yml` exclusively via `MATRIX_SINGLETON_PACK`. Removed.
- **`docker/docker-compose.receiver.yml`** — old standalone receiver compose, superseded by root `docker-compose.yml`. Removed.
- **`icsforge/state/plc_state.py`** — `PLCState` class never used by any code outside its own `__init__.py`. Removed.
- **`icsforge/detection/generic.py`** — `validate()` function never called from anywhere. Removed.
- **`icsforge/detection/suricata.py`** — `validate_suricata()` never called from anywhere. Removed.
- **`icsforge/detection/zeek.py`** — `validate_zeek()` never called from anywhere. Removed.
- **`out/`** empty directory — runtime artifact, should not be in repo. Removed.

### Directory Merge: `detections/` → `detection/`
- Merged `icsforge/detections/generator.py` into `icsforge/detection/generator.py`
- Deleted the entire `icsforge/detections/` directory
- Updated all imports (`icsforge.detections.generator` → `icsforge.detection.generator`) in `web/app.py` and `tests/test_scenarios.py`
- `icsforge/detection/` is now the single detection package containing `mapping.py` (alert correlation) and `generator.py` (Suricata/Sigma rule generation)

### Stale Version Strings
- Replaced all `v0.30` references in `campaigns/__init__.py`, `reports/__init__.py`, `reports/coverage.py`, `web/app.py`

### Updated Exports
- `icsforge/detection/__init__.py` now exports only used functions: `correlate_run`, `map_alert_to_techniques`, `generate_all`
- `icsforge/state/__init__.py` exports only `RunRegistry` and `default_db_path` (removed unused `PLCState`)

---

## v0.42.1 (2026-03)

### Lint Cleanup
- Sorted imports in all 32 Python source files (stdlib → third-party → local with blank line separation)
- Fixed E741 ambiguous variable names (`l` → `line`/`ln` in `detection/zeek.py` and `test_scenarios.py`)
- Removed trailing whitespace (W291/W293) across 7 files
- Removed excessive blank lines (E303) throughout codebase
- All 44 Python files compile clean with zero syntax errors

### CI: Lint + Test Pipeline
- Added dedicated `lint` job to GitHub Actions CI: `ruff check icsforge/ tests/`
- Test job now depends on lint passing first (`needs: lint`)
- Lint runs on Python 3.12, tests run on 3.10–3.13 matrix
- Added Tests passing badge to README

---

## v0.42.0 (2026-03)

### Bug Fixes (from developer review)
- **`/api/correlate_run` crash fixed** — `import time` added at module level in `web/app.py`. Previously crashed with `NameError: name 'time' is not defined` when generating correlation report filenames. Tested end-to-end: empty body → 400, unknown run → 400, real run → 200 with valid correlation.
- **README API path corrected** — was `GET /api/generate_detection_rules` (404), now correctly documents `GET /api/detections/preview` and `GET /api/detections/download`
- **`docs/PHASE.md` updated** — was "120+ scenarios", now accurate with 155 scenarios, 8 protocols

### Lint Cleanup
- Resolved all 59 lint issues (46 F401 unused imports, 10 F541 f-strings without placeholders, 3 E722 bare excepts)
- Added `__all__` to all `__init__.py` re-export modules (`detection`, `live`, `protocols`, `receiver`, `state`, `web`)
- Fixed bare `except:` in `detection/generic.py` and `detection/suricata.py` → `except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError):`
- Removed unnecessary `from __future__ import annotations` from 12 files
- Removed unused imports: `defaultdict`, `session`, `yaml`, `tempfile`, `time`, `rand_ip`, `Path`, `is_allowed_dest`, typing members
- Fixed f-prefix on string literals without placeholders in `detections/generator.py`

### Scenario Metadata Normalization
- All 155 scenarios now have a top-level `technique:` field (was missing on 73 scenarios)
- CHAIN scenarios get primary technique from their attack chain
- UI/export/summary logic can now rely on scenario-level metadata consistently

### Official Count Wording
README Key Numbers table uses precise, defensible wording:
- 155 runnable scenarios in the main scenario pack
- 72 ATT&CK for ICS technique IDs exercised across runnable scenarios
- 83 techniques in support data, 86 in bundled matrix data
- 8 industrial protocols

### New Tests
- `tests/test_web_api.py` — Flask test client tests for:
  - `/api/correlate_run`: empty body → 400, unknown run → 400, full end-to-end → 200 with correlation data
  - `/api/detections/preview` and `/api/detections/download`: return 200
  - Old wrong path `/api/generate_detection_rules`: returns 404
  - Basic endpoints: `/api/health`, `/api/scenarios`, `/api/packs`, `/api/runs`
  - Route audit: all README-documented routes exist in Flask app
  - POST routes with empty body return 400 (not 500)

- **README API path corrected** — was `GET /api/generate_detection_rules` (404), now correctly documents `GET /api/detections/preview` and `GET /api/detections/download`
- **`docs/PHASE.md` updated** — was "120+ scenarios", now matches actual 155 with 8 protocols

### Scenario Metadata Normalization
- All 155 scenarios now have a top-level `technique:` field (was missing on 73 scenarios)
- CHAIN scenarios get primary technique from first step
- UI/export/summary logic can now rely on scenario-level metadata consistently

### Official Count Wording
README Key Numbers table now uses precise, defensible wording:
- 155 runnable scenarios in the main scenario pack

## v0.4.0 (2026-03)

### Engineering & Packaging
- **pyproject.toml**: Full PEP 621 packaging with entry points (`icsforge`, `icsforge-web`, `icsforge-receiver`). Pip-installable: `pip install -e .`
- **Scapy made optional**: Core engine is pure Python. Scapy only needed for pcap replay (`pip install icsforge[replay]`)
- **Dependency ranges**: Replaced pinned versions with compatible ranges in requirements.txt

### Testing
- **pytest test suite**: 100+ tests covering all 7 protocol builders, core utilities, scenario engine, and detection generator
- **Protocol builder tests**: Every documented style verified for all protocols (Modbus 28+, DNP3 17+, S7comm 25+, IEC-104 18+, OPC UA 16+, ENIP 15+, PROFINET 5+)
- **PCAP validation tests**: Verify global header magic, packet structure, and timing jitter
- **Detection generator tests**: Suricata and Sigma rule generation coverage
- **GitHub Actions CI**: Matrix testing across Python 3.10–3.13, Docker image builds

### Protocol Fixes
- **DNP3 CRC-16**: Implemented proper CRC-16/DNP (polynomial 0x3D65) per IEEE 1815. Link header and data block CRCs now computed correctly instead of placeholder zeros
- **PCAP timing jitter**: Packet timestamps now include ±30% jitter around base interval, eliminating the uniform-spacing pattern that flagged synthetic PCAPs in Wireshark

### Logging
- **Structured logging framework** (`icsforge.log`): All `print()` statements replaced with Python `logging` module. Configurable via `--log-level`, `--verbose`, `--log-file`, or `ICSFORGE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
- Consistent log format across sender, receiver, web UI, and CLI
- Third-party logger suppression (werkzeug, urllib3)

### Receiver
- **Thread-safe receipt writing**: `threading.Lock()` protects JSONL file writes from concurrent TCP handler corruption
- **Proper error handling**: All TCP accept/handler errors logged instead of silently swallowed
- **Bind error reporting**: Clear error messages when ports are already in use

### Web Application
- **Flask secret key**: Cryptographic secret key generated on startup (configurable via `ICSFORGE_SECRET_KEY`)
- **Session security**: HttpOnly and SameSite=Lax cookie settings
- **Fixed duplicate code**: `/api/send` handler had 6 duplicate variable assignments (timeout, allowlist, iface, src_ip, outdir assigned twice each)
- **Deprecated API fixed**: All `datetime.utcnow()` replaced with timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
- **HTTP output logging**: `_send_http()` now logs failures instead of silently passing

### Docker
- **docker-compose.yml**: Full-stack setup with sender, receiver, and optional Suricata in isolated bridge network
- **Updated Dockerfiles**: Python 3.12-slim base, proper output directory creation
- **Suricata profile**: Opt-in IDS monitoring via `docker compose --profile suricata up`

### Community & CI
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Development setup, testing guide, code style, protocol/scenario addition guides
- **GitHub issue templates**: Bug report and feature request templates
- **.github/workflows/ci.yml**: Automated testing, linting, coverage, and Docker builds
- **Updated README**: Architecture diagram, badges, quick-start guide, protocol coverage table

### Code Quality
- **core.py**: `_send_http` error logging, proper timezone handling throughout
- **state/run_registry.py**: Fixed deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` usage
- **cli.py**: Added `--verbose`, `--log-level`, `--log-file` global flags
